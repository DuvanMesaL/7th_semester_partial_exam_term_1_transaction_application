## üìù Overview

This project is a comprehensive banking transaction application built on a microservices architecture. It allows users to manage accounts, perform transactions, and monitor their financial activities through a sleek, modern interface.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of the following microservices:

- **User Service** - Manages user registration, authentication, and profile data
- **Account Service** - Handles account creation, balance management, and transactions
- **Logs Service** - Records all system activities for audit and debugging
- **Mailing Service** - Manages email notifications for important account activities

Each microservice is designed to operate independently, with its own database and business logic.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| MongoDB | 4.4+ | NoSQL database for user data and logs |
| PostgreSQL | 12+ | Relational database for transaction records |
| Node.js | 16+ | JavaScript runtime environment |
| npm | 7+ | Node.js package manager |
| Git | Any | Version control system |

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DuvanMesaL/7th_semester_partial_exam_term_1_transaction_application.git
cd 7th_semester_partial_exam_term_1_transaction_application
```

### 2. Install microservices dependencies

```bash
# Account Microservice
cd Back/microservice-account
npm install

# User Microservice
cd ../microservice-user
npm install

# Logs Microservice
cd ../microservice-logs
npm install

# Mailing Microservice
cd ../microservice-mailing
npm install
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../../monigo
npm install
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Copy the example environment files in each microservice folder:

```bash
cp Back/microservice-account/.env.example Back/microservice-account/.env
cp Back/microservice-user/.env.example Back/microservice-user/.env
cp Back/microservice-logs/.env.example Back/microservice-logs/.env
cp Back/microservice-mailing/.env.example Back/microservice-mailing/.env
```

Edit each `.env` file with your specific configuration settings.

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Start the databases

Ensure MongoDB and PostgreSQL services are running:

```bash
# Check MongoDB status
mongod --version

# Check PostgreSQL status
pg_isready
```

### Launch the microservices

In separate terminal windows:

```bash
# Start Account Microservice
cd Back/microservice-account
npm run dev

# Start User Microservice
cd ../microservice-user
npm run dev

# Start Logs Microservice
cd ../microservice-logs
npm run dev

# Start Mailing Microservice
cd ../microservice-mailing
npm run dev
```

### Start the frontend

```bash
